What does HEAD refer to in the context of git?
First, I save the file on my computer (this is the working directory)
This pushes it to my index
Then, I commit the changes, which creates a new HEAD


Steps:
Create the repo
Create a local clone
Make local changes and commit to local master
Push your local changes to GitHub
